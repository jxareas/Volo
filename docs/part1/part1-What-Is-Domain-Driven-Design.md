## What is Domain Driven Design

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for **complex** needs by connecting the implementation to an **evolving** model;

DDD is suitable for **complex domains** and **large-scale** applications rather than simple CRUD applications. It focuses on the **core domain logic** rather than the infrastructure details. It helps to build a **flexible**, modular and **maintainable** code base.

### OOP & SOLID

Implementing DDD highly relies on the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles. Actually, it **implements** and **extends** these principles. So, a **good understanding** of OOP & SOLID helps you a lot while truly implementing the DDD.

### DDD Layers & Clean Architecture

There are four fundamental layers of a Domain Driven Based Solution;

**Business Logic** places into two layers, the *Domain layer* and the *Application Layer*, while they contain different kinds of business logic;

* **Domain Layer** implements the core, use-case independent business logic of the domain/system.
* **Application Layer** implements the use cases of the application based on the domain. A use case can be thought as a user interaction on the User Interface (UI).
* **Presentation Layer** contains the UI elements (pages, components) of the application.
* **Infrastructure Layer** supports other layer by implementing the abstractions and integrations to 3rd-party library and systems.

The same layering can be shown as the diagram below and known as the **Clean Architecture**, or sometimes the **Onion Architecture**:

In the Clean Architecture, each layer only **depends on the layer directly inside it**. The most independent layer is shown in the most inner circle and it is the Domain Layer.

### Core Building Blocks

DDD mostly **focuses on the Domain & Application Layers** and ignores the Presentation and Infrastructure. They are seen as *details* and the business layers should not depend on them.

That doesn't mean the Presentation and Infrastructure layers are not important. They are very important. UI frameworks and database providers have their own rules and best practices that you need to know and apply. However these are not in the topics of DDD.

This section introduces the essential building blocks of the Domain & Application Layers.

#### Domain Layer Building Blocks

* **Entity**: An [Entity](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Entities) is an object with its own properties (state, data) and methods that implements the business logic that is executed on these properties. An entity is represented by its unique identifier (Id). Two entity object with different Ids are considered as different entities.
* **Value Object**: A [Value Object](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Value-Objects) is another kind of domain object that is identified by its properties rather than a unique Id. That means two Value Objects with same properties are considered as the same object. Value objects are generally implemented as immutable and mostly are much simpler than the Entities.
* **Aggregate & Aggregate Root**: An [Aggregate](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Entities) is a cluster of objects (entities and value objects) bound together by an **Aggregate Root** object. The Aggregate Root is a specific type of an entity with some additional responsibilities.
* **Repository** (interface): A [Repository](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Repositories) is a collection-like interface that is used by the Domain and Application Layers to access to the data persistence system (the database). It hides the complexity of the DBMS from the business code. Domain Layer contains the `interface`s of the repositories.
* **Domain Service**: A [Domain Service](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Services) is a stateless service that implements core business rules of the domain. It is useful to implement domain logic that depends on multiple aggregate (entity) type or some external services.
* **Specification**: A [Specification](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Specifications) is used to define named, reusable and combinable filters for entities and other business objects.
* **Domain Event**: A [Domain Event](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Event-Bus) is a way of informing other services in a loosely coupled manner, when a domain specific event occurs.

#### Application Layer Building Blocks

* **Application Service**: An [Application Service](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Application-Services) is a stateless service that implements use cases of the application. An application service typically gets and returns DTOs. It is used by the Presentation Layer. It uses and coordinates the domain objects to implement the use cases. A use case is typically considered as a Unit Of Work.
* **Data Transfer Object (DTO)**: A [DTO](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Data-Transfer-Objects) is a simple object without any business logic that is used to transfer state (data) between the Application and Presentation Layers.
* **Unit of Work (UOW)**: A [Unit of Work](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Unit-Of-Work) is an atomic work that should be done as a transaction unit. All the operations inside a UOW should be committed on success or rolled back on a failure.
